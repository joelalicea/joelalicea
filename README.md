My skills include business analytics, data visualization and storytelling, and SQL. I am eager to leverage my big data and visualization skills in the e-commerce and customer service sectors to drive growth and boost sales.

Currently, I am working with customer data to find ways of attracting more sales and increasing business metrics. In 2023, I enrolled in the TripleTen 6-month Business Intelligence Analytics program. The curriculum covered Google Sheets (Excel), data visualization (Tableau), SQL, and more. It also involved numerous practical projects.

Some facts about me:

*   l enjoy participating in professional sporting events, especially  because I enjoy player stats and tracking them on ESPN
*   I love gaming and even used to run friendly competitions with family and friends.
*   l also dislike cooking but prefer to eat in as a healthier option.
*   My goals for 2024: landing my dream job in data and getting to travel with my wife.

Feel free to contact me on GitHub or Linkedin!</p>
